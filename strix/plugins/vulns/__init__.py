"""Vulnerability Plugin Base Classes.

Design Principles:
1. Plugins ONLY generate payloads - they don't make vulnerability judgments
2. Plugins don't execute HTTP requests - Controller handles that
3. Plugins don't determine if vulnerabilities exist - AI Brain does that
4. Plugins only receive LLM judgment results and do post-processing
